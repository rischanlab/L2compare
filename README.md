# Evaluating Layer 2 Solutions for DApp Deployment 

# Project Abstract
When developers or companies plan to build decentralized applications (DApps) on Ethereum, they face a critical decision: which Layer 2 (L2) network to use? Each L2 solution offers different benefits in terms of scalability, transaction costs, and security models. However, there is currently no comprehensive academic study that evaluates all available Ethereum L2 solutions, particularly from a financial perspective. This research aims to fill that gap by analyzing existing L2s, their core technologies, and their financial sustainability based on three key metrics: **reach, retention, and revenue**. Our study will provide an in-depth comparison of L2 solutions, helping developers make informed choices when selecting an L2 for their DApp.

# Objectives
- Create a comprehensive academic review of all available Ethereum L2 solutions, explaining their fundamental technologies, security models, and operational mechanisms.
- Analyze financial performance across L2s by focusing on three key metrics: **reach (adoption), retention (user stickiness), and revenue (economic sustainability).**
- Provide a decision-making framework to help DApp developers select the most suitable L2 based on technical and financial considerations.

**Measuring Success:**
- A published research paper detailing the analysis of all major Ethereum L2 solutions.
- A structured comparison framework for developers to evaluate and select an L2 network.
- An open-access dashboard or dataset summarizing financial and technical insights on L2s.

# Outcomes
- Guide developers and enterprises in selecting the most efficient and economically sustainable L2.
- Contribute to Ethereumâ€™s long-term scalability by offering clear insights into how different L2s perform under real-world conditions.
- Enhance transparency in the L2 ecosystem by documenting their financial sustainability and usage trends.
- Encourage competition and improvement among L2 solutions by highlighting strengths and weaknesses across key performance indicators.

# Scope

## Research Topics
1. **Overview of Ethereum L2 Solutions** â€“ Documenting all available L2s, their rollup mechanisms, and security models.
2. **Financial Metrics Analysis** â€“ Assessing L2 reach, retention, and revenue using blockchain data and analytics tools.
3. **Decision Framework** â€“ Creating a structured evaluation tool for developers based on real-world data.

## Expected Outputs
- A pre-print paper will be submitted to **arXiv**.
- To reach a broader audience, the paper will be submitted to **IEEE Access**, leveraging prior experience in publishing in this journal.
- A **data repository/dashboard** with real-time L2 financial metrics.
- A **developerâ€™s guide** to choosing the right L2 based on technical and financial factors.

# Related Work
- Research studies on Ethereum scalability and rollups, including **EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding) and Rollup Economics**.
- Industry reports from **Nansen, Token Terminal, and L2Beat** analyzing L2 adoption trends.
- Academic papers on **rollup security models, economic incentives, and transaction fee structures**.
- **Gap in research:** Existing studies focus on technical scalability; few analyze L2s from an economic sustainability perspective.

# Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Using on-chain analytics tools (**Dune, FlipsideCrypto, L2Beat, Nansen**) to gather real-time data on L2 performance.
- **Qualitative Analysis:** Reviewing L2 whitepapers and existing work in academia, governance structures, and security trade-offs.
- **Financial Metrics Computation:** Evaluating reach, retention, and revenue using cohort analysis, transaction fee modeling, and blockchain economic principles.
- **Framework Development:** Creating a structured evaluation guide for developers.
