| **Arbitrum One**    | Optimistic Rollup       | Up to ~40,000 TPS theoretical, with typical fees only a few cents ([What is Arbitrum? Deep Dive Guide](https://www.hord.fi/blog/arbitrum-network-explained#:~:text=to%20achieve%20high%20throughput%20and,also%20be%20deployed%20on%20Arbitrum)). Real-world throughput is currently limited by Ethereum data posting (often tens of TPS) and ~1–2 min L2 block times. | Most adopted L2 (launched 2021). ~$12.7B TVL (largest among L2s) ([L2BEAT - The state of the layer two ecosystem](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvs#:~:text=1%20%2082Arbitrum%20One%20,73%20M)). Robust DeFi ecosystem and active developer community.

| **Arbitrum Nova**   | *“AnyTrust” Optimistic Rollup*  | Similar throughput to Arbitrum One, but with much lower fees (data stored off-chain via a committee) – ideal for social/gaming apps. Trades some security for cheaper transactions. | Launched 2022 for Reddit *Community Points* and high-volume dApps. Still smaller ecosystem vs. Arbitrum One, but growing with gaming and social projects. | Reddit Community Points (e.g. r/CryptoCurrency Moons), and games/social dApps that require ultra-low fees.            | Uses a Data Availability Committee (DAC) for data – **introduces trust assumptions** ([Arbitrum FAQ | Arbitrum Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/learn-more/faq#:~:text=By%20contrast%2C%20Arbitrum%20AnyTrust%20introduces,value%20of%202)). Security relies on ≥2 of 20 committee members being honest (if most committee and sequencer collude, safety can be broken ([Arbitrum FAQ | Arbitrum Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/learn-more/faq#:~:text=By%20contrast%2C%20Arbitrum%20AnyTrust%20introduces,value%20of%202))). Sequencer is centralized (Offchain Labs). Designed for *less critical* use-cases given trust trade-off. | Official bridge to L1 with **fast confirmation** (when DAC honest). Withdrawal also ~7 days if falls back to rollup mode. Lower liquidity than Arbitrum One, but still supported by Arbitrum’s bridge and some third-party bridges. Limited direct exchange support. |
| **Optimism (OP Mainnet)** | Optimistic Rollup    | On par with Arbitrum: can handle thousands of TPS (up to ~4,000 TPS claimed) ([Optimism vs Polkadot | Chain Compare](https://chain.compare/optimism-vs-polkadot#:~:text=Is%20Optimism%20faster%20than%20Polkadot%3F,Is%20Optimism%20cheaper%20than%20Polkadot)). Typical tx fees on the order of 0.1–0.2 USD ([L2 Fees](https://l2fees.info/#:~:text=Optimism,is%20throttled%20while%20in)) (significantly cheaper than L1). ~2 second L2 blocks, ~1 minute confirmation. | One of the first rollups (launched 2021). $4.4B+ TVL ([L2BEAT - The state of the layer two ecosystem](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvs#:~:text=2%20%2083Base%20%2022%244,25)), second-largest L2. Strong developer support (OP Stack open-source framework). Growing “Superchain” ecosystem of OP Stack chains. OP governance token launched 2022 with incentive programs. | **Synthetix** (derivatives, ~$125M TVL) and **Uniswap v3** are top protocols ([A Review of the Optimism Blockchain - Blog - Poolz.Finance](https://blog.poolz.finance/a-review-of-the-optimism-blockchain/#:~:text=their%20smart%20contracts,include%20Synthetix%2C%20Uniswap%2C%20and%20Aave)), plus Aave, Curve, and native projects like **Velodrome** (DEX), **Lyra** (options AMM), **Polynomial** (structured products) etc. Over 70 protocols deployed ([Optimism | Deep Dive - Cryptonary](https://cryptonary.com/research/optimism-deep-dive/#:~:text=Optimism%20%7C%20Deep%20Dive%20,these%20protocols%20as%20%E2%80%9Cmajor%E2%80%9D)) ([A Review of the Optimism Blockchain - Blog - Poolz.Finance](https://blog.poolz.finance/a-review-of-the-optimism-blockchain/#:~:text=their%20smart%20contracts,include%20Synthetix%2C%20Uniswap%2C%20and%20Aave)). | Secured by Ethereum (fraud proofs). Uses a one-week withdrawal challenge period like Arbitrum. **Sequencer is currently centralized** (run by OP Labs/Foundation) ([The Ultimate Guide to Sequencers in L2 Blockchains - Jarrod Watts](https://blog.jarrodwatts.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-sequencers-in-l2-blockchains#:~:text=today,l2beat)). Plans for decentralizing sequencing and fault-proof participants. Upgrade keys initially in a multisig; moving toward token-holder governance via the Optimism Collective. | **Canonical bridge** to Ethereum (7-day exits). Many third-party bridges (Hop, Celer, Connext) available for fast exits. Widely supported by major exchanges (Coinbase, Binance support direct OP deposits) and integrated into wallets. Native USDC is issued on Optimism, improving liquidity (replacing older bridged USDC) ([What is the difference between native USDC and bridged USDC.e ...](https://help.request.finance/en/articles/8793285-what-is-the-difference-between-native-usdc-and-bridged-usdc-e-on-polygon-optimism-arbitrum-and-zksync-era#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20difference%20between,USDC)). |
| **Base**            | Optimistic Rollup       | Similar performance to Optimism (built on OP Stack). Aims for high throughput ~10^3 TPS; Base hit ~80 TPS in early tests ([Starknet hits record 857 TPS, averages 127.5 in stress test](https://cointelegraph.com/news/starknet-stress-test-tps-record-scaling-ethereum#:~:text=According%20to%20L2Beat%20data%2C%20Starknet%E2%80%99s,increase%20over%20the%20Coinbase%20network)). Fees are low (often <$0.10 per tx). ~12 sec block time, fast confirmation. | Launched 2023 by Coinbase. Rapid adoption due to Coinbase user base – climbed to ~$11.4B TVL by 2025 ([L2BEAT - The state of the layer two ecosystem](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvs#:~:text=1%20%2082Arbitrum%20One%20,73%20M)) (rivaling Arbitrum). Developer-friendly (no native token, uses ETH for gas). Part of OP Stack “Superchain” vision. Still new but growing quickly. | **Friend.tech** (social token app that drove activity), **Uniswap** and **Curve** deployed, **Balancer** and other DeFi, and Coinbase’s own dApps (Onchain Summer NFTs, etc.). Many new social and gaming apps choose Base for its low fees and trusted brand. | Built as an Ethereum rollup (inherits L1 security). Uses standard optimistic fraud proofs (7-day window). **Sequencer is run by Coinbase**, so currently centralized (operationally). Coinbase has pledged to progressively decentralize Base and align with the OP governance for shared security in future. | **Official bridge** (Coinbase Bridge) for L1<>Base (7-day withdrawal delay). Third-party bridges (e.g. Wormhole, LayerZero) also support Base. Major exchanges (Coinbase integrates Base natively; others like Binance added support) making it easy to move funds. **Fiat on-ramps** via Coinbase and partners are available. USDC is natively supported (bridged via Circle’s protocol), ensuring deep liquidity. |
| **Mantle Network**  | Optimistic Rollup (Modular) | Similar throughput to other OP rollups, but uses modular data availability off-chain to lower costs. Aims for high TPS by using EigenDA (data layer) ([Mantle Network, Modular Layer 2 Revolutionizing DeFi](https://xangle.io/en/research/detail/2041#:~:text=Mantle%20Network%2C%20Modular%20Layer%202,liquid%20staking%20and%20restaking%2C)). Low fees (pennies per tx). | Launched 2023 by BitDAO (token: MNT). Still growing – a few hundred million TVL. Focus on DeFi (“liquidity hub”) with BitDAO treasury support. Decent developer interest due to unique design (first rollup to use EigenLayer DA). | Early-stage DeFi projects like **Permaswap** and **FusionX**; some deployments of known protocols (e.g. decentralized exchanges, lending apps). Not yet as many blue-chip dApps as Arbitrum/OP, but incentivizing ecosystem growth. | Inherits Ethereum security for fraud proofs, but **uses EigenLayer for data availability** (not all data on L1). This introduces a new trust assumption on the DA committee/stakers ([Mantle Network, Modular Layer 2 Revolutionizing DeFi](https://xangle.io/en/research/detail/2041#:~:text=Mantle%20Network%2C%20Modular%20Layer%202,liquid%20staking%20and%20restaking%2C)). Sequencer centralized (run by Mantle team) at launch. Mantle’s roadmap includes decentralizing sequencing and leveraging $MNT governance. | **Bridge**: Mantle has a canonical Ethereum bridge (with 1-week exits). Being OP Stack-based, it’s compatible with standard bridges and the OP “Superchain.” Major exchanges are beginning to list MNT and support Mantle withdrawals. Liquidity is growing; stablecoins are bridged from Ethereum (no native USDC yet). |
| **Boba Network**    | Optimistic Rollup       | Similar baseline performance (~1000+ TPS possible). Low fees (fractions of ETH gas). Added features like hybrid compute for off-chain calls. | Launched 2021 as a fork of Optimism. Moderate adoption – TVL under $10M ([L2BEAT - The state of the layer two ecosystem](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvs#:~:text=28%20%20109Zora%20%2048%2413,50%2050%20%2441%20K)) by 2025. Had initial usage via OMG token airdrop, but ecosystem growth has been limited compared to Arbitrum/OP. Operates on Ethereum and also extended to other L1s. | A few DeFi and gaming dApps (OolongSwap DEX, Tether uses Boba for cheap transfers, etc.). Not many top-tier projects; ecosystem is relatively small.                                                                          | Standard optimistic rollup security (inherits Ethereum). **Sequencer is centralized** (managed by Enya/OMG team). Boba introduced a token (BOBA) for governance, but network upgrades/ops still largely centralized.                                                                      | **Boba bridge** for Ethereum transfers (7-day exit). Third-party bridges and some exchange integration exist (e.g. Bitfinex supported OMG/Boba bridging). Overall liquidity is low; limited direct fiat on-ramps. Most activity involves bridging assets from Ethereum mainnet. |
| **Metis Andromeda** | Optimistic Rollup       | Fork of Optimism with aims of high TPS (theoretical thousands). Low fees (~$0.1 or less for token swaps). Metis introduced optimized batching for slightly faster throughput. | Launched late 2021. Medium maturity – peaked at >$100M TVL, now smaller. Focus on dApp tooling (DACs, IPFS integration) and a decentralized sequencer vision. Active community but fewer major apps. | Native projects like **Netswap** (DEX) and **Tethys**, plus some deployments of SushiSwap and Aave. Used by some Web3 startups for DAOs and gig-economy dApps (the Metis vision). | Inherits Ethereum security; uses fraud proofs (currently with whitelisted validators). Metis has worked on a **decentralized sequencer pool** concept ([PoS Sequencer Pool: Decentralizing an Optimistic Rollup - Layer 2](https://ethresear.ch/t/pos-sequencer-pool-decentralizing-an-optimistic-rollup/16760#:~:text=PoS%20Sequencer%20Pool%3A%20Decentralizing%20an,to%20a%20decentralized%20sequencer%20pool)) but as of 2025 the sequencer remains centralized. Governance via METIS token, but core upgrades still team-controlled. | **Bridge**: Metis provides a canonical bridge (7-day withdrawal). Also integrated in multi-chain bridges (PolyNetwork, etc.). Not widely supported on major CEXs; users typically bridge from Ethereum or other L2s. Stablecoin liquidity exists via bridged USDC/USDT; no native fiat ramps. |
| **Zora Network**    | Optimistic Rollup       | Built on OP Stack; identical core performance (targeting thousands of TPS). Very low gas fees (often <$0.05). Optimized for NFT minting (cheap batch minting). | Launched 2023 for on-chain media/NFTs. Still emerging – backed by Zora (NFT marketplace). Attracted NFT creators due to low costs. Smaller DeFi presence. | **Zora NFT marketplace** (native to the chain). Creators launching NFT drops and social tokens on Zora. Few traditional DeFi apps since focus is creators/collectibles. | Standard OP rollup security (posts data to Ethereum). **Sequencer centralized** (run by Zora team). Part of Optimism’s Superchain, so expects shared security developments. Governance is currently by Zora; no separate token for network. | **Bridge**: Uses the OP Stack bridge to Ethereum (7-day exits). Integrated with Zora’s own app for easy NFT bridging. Limited exchange support (mostly use Ethereum bridge). Decent liquidity in NFT assets; ERC-20 liquidity is minimal aside from bridging in tokens for fees. |
| **Worldcoin’s World Chain** | Optimistic Rollup (OP Stack) | Built to prioritize massive user scalability – targeting high TPS by raising block gas limits ([Finding a scalable home for Worldcoin](https://world.org/blog/engineering/finding-scalable-home-for-worldcoin#:~:text=Finding%20a%20scalable%20home%20for,limit%20by%20a%20significant%20factor)). Possibly >1000 TPS with ~5× faster proving than standard OP. Ultra-low fees (fractions of a cent for basic transfers). | Launched 2023–24 by Worldcoin (renamed “World” project). Early-stage – designed for *proof-of-personhood* and global user transactions. Adoption tied to World App and World ID usage (already millions of sign-ups). | **World App** (transfers and identity attestation using Worldcoin tokens). Focused on payments, identity and airdrops rather than hosting many DeFi dApps. Ecosystem is mostly Worldcoin-specific apps currently. | OP Stack rollup inheriting Ethereum security. Uses a permissioned sequencer (Worldcoin Foundation). Unique mechanism gives verified humans priority in block space. Not fully decentralized yet (relies on Worldcoin org), but plans to integrate into Optimism’s shared sequencing if possible. | **Bridge**: Standard OP bridge to Ethereum for WLD token and other assets (7-day exit). Some exchanges (e.g. Binance) list WLD and support direct withdrawal to World Chain. World App offers fiat on-ramps for WLD. Liquidity is mainly the WLD token (which is bridged between Ethereum mainnet and World Chain). |
| **Uniswap’s Unichain** | Optimistic Rollup (OP Stack) | Similar base performance to Optimism (high TPS, low fees) but with custom optimizations to minimize MEV and improve throughput for DeFi. Aims for <1s block times for fast trades. | Launched 2024 by Uniswap Labs. New but notable – specifically built as an L2 home for DeFi. Still in early growth; backed by Uniswap’s reputation. Likely to attract many liquidity providers and protocols over time. | **Uniswap v4** will reside here (Uni’s own flagship DEX on Unichain). Expecting other DeFi protocols to join for deep liquidity (given Uniswap’s invitation). Early integrations with lending protocols and cross-chain liquidity providers are underway. | Standard Optimistic rollup security model. **Sequencer initially centralized** (run by Uniswap Labs or delegates). Unichain is part of the Optimism Superchain, so it benefits from shared security efforts. Governance will involve UNI token holders for the chain’s parameters. | **Bridge**: Utilizes the OP Stack canonical bridge. Uniswap may facilitate seamless bridging via its interface. Not yet supported by centralized exchanges (requires bridging from Ethereum or other L2s). Liquidity will concentrate around Uniswap’s pools; stablecoins and ETH can be bridged from mainnet (no native stablecoin yet). |
| **Kroma**           | Optimistic Rollup (OP Stack) | Standard OP Stack performance (hundreds+ TPS). Low fees; has tuned infrastructure aiming for 10% cheaper gas than vanilla OP Stack. | Launched 2023 with support from Korean tech firms. Still small (~$6–7M TVL ([L2BEAT - The state of the layer two ecosystem](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvs#:~:text=30%20%20111Polynomial%20%2050%2441,91%20M))). Targeting gaming and Asian DeFi projects. | A few regional projects (Korean gaming dApps, local DeFi apps). Not widely used internationally yet. | OP Stack rollup on Ethereum – inherits L1 security. **Claims to be first with permissionless sequencer validator set** (experimentally) ([The state of Arbitrum's progressive decentralization - Governance docs](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization#:~:text=docs%20docs,Validator%20ownership%3B%20Sequencer%20ownership)) ([What Are Sequencers in Layer 2 Protocols Such as Optimism ...](https://unchainedcrypto.com/what-are-sequencers-in-layer-2-protocols-such-as-optimism-arbitrum-and-base/#:~:text=Layer%202%20sequencers%20are%20responsible,transactions%20are%20in%20correct%20order)), but likely still in progress. Currently semi-centralized. | **Bridge**: Uses OP Stack bridge. Third-party bridges (Orbit, etc.) also added support. Mainly regional exchange integration (some Asian exchanges support KROM token). Liquidity is limited; relies on bridging from Ethereum for major assets. |
| **Other OP Stack Chains (OP “Superchain”)** | Optimistic Rollups       | *Examples:* **Mode Network** (DeFi+AI focused OP chain), **Blast** (rollup with built-in yield incentives ([The L2 that helps you Earn more - Infura](https://www.infura.io/networks/ethereum/blast#:~:text=Discover%20native%20yield%20opportunities%20on,automated%20rebasing%2C%20gas%20revenue%20sharing))), **Ink** etc. – all share similar throughput (fast L2 blocks, cheap fees) as Optimism. | Most launched in 2023–24. Varying adoption – e.g., Mode is new (AI+agents theme), Blast (by Blur NFT marketplace team) launched with an airdrop and saw ~$428M TVS ([Blast | TVS Breakdown – L2BEAT](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/blast/tvs-breakdown#:~:text=Total%20value%20secured%20Total%20value,secured%20Total)). Generally early-stage with niche focuses. | **Mode:** building “AI-Fi” agent apps; **Blast:** Blur’s NFT trading and yield apps ([What is Blast? Blur's Native Yield L2 and Token Airdrop Explained](https://dappradar.com/blog/blast-layer-2-chain-guide#:~:text=Explained%20dappradar,Blur%2C%20the%20popular%20NFT%20marketplace)); **Paradex/Ink:** experimental DeFi protocols. These chains often host the specific projects of their founders and aim to attract others via incentives. | All are based on the OP Stack, inheriting Ethereum security with optimistic fraud proofs. Most have **centralized sequencers** run by the project team initially (with plans to decentralize). They rely on Ethereum’s security but may use custom governance tokens for local control. | Each has a standard OP-style bridge to Ethereum. Liquidity depends on the founding project (e.g., Blast incentivizes ETH and stablecoin liquidity natively). Many will connect into the broader Superchain, enabling seamless bridging between OP chains in the future. Direct fiat/exchange support is minimal unless the parent project integrates it. |
| **zkSync Era**      | ZK Rollup (zkEVM)       | ~20–50+ TPS initially (with more as demand grows ([zkSync Era launches with Uniswap and Sushi — First zkEVM on mainnet](https://cointelegraph.com/news/zksync-era-launches-with-uniswap-and-sushi-first-zkevm-on-mainnet#:~:text=While%20zkSync%20Era%20can%20provide,scale%20up%20as%20demand%20requires))), but **can theoretically scale to thousands TPS** as proving optimizes. Validity proofs allow near-instant finality on L1 once generated (no week-long wait). Typical fees are a few cents – significantly lower than L1. | Mainnet launched Q1 2023. **Matured quickly** – ~$820M TVL ([L2BEAT - The state of the layer two ecosystem](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvs#:~:text=3%20%2084OP%20Mainnet%20,73%20M)). First EVM-compatible ZK-rollup on mainnet. Dozens of projects deployed from day one ([zkSync Era launches with Uniswap and Sushi — First zkEVM on mainnet](https://cointelegraph.com/news/zksync-era-launches-with-uniswap-and-sushi-first-zkevm-on-mainnet#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20biggest%20names,up%20zkSync%20Era)). Active developer ecosystem (Matter Labs SDK) and growing user base (many anticipating a token airdrop, though token not yet live by 2025). | **Uniswap v3, Curve, SushiSwap, MakerDAO, Balancer** deployed or announced ([zkSync Era launches with Uniswap and Sushi — First zkEVM on mainnet](https://cointelegraph.com/news/zksync-era-launches-with-uniswap-and-sushi-first-zkevm-on-mainnet#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20biggest%20names,up%20zkSync%20Era)). Native projects like **Mute** and **SyncSwap** (DEXes), **ZigZag** (orderbook exchange), **Orbiter Finance** (bridge) etc. NFTs (zkSync Lite had NFTs, Era supports general smart contracts). Many Ethereum dApps are expanding to zkSync Era given its EVM support. | Secured by Ethereum with validity proofs (**zero-knowledge SNARKs**). All transactions are proven correct before L1 acceptance – provides strong security and no fraud window. **Sequencer and prover are centralized** (operated by Matter Labs) at present – users rely on Matter Labs for liveness. The system is upgradable (was developer-controlled, though plan to hand over to community/tokens). Over time, zkSync aims for decentralization of operators once tech matures. | **Native L1 bridge** for zkSync (trustless and fast – proof verification on Ethereum). No withdrawal delay (funds unlock as soon as proof is confirmed, typically minutes). **Major exchanges are beginning support** (Binance integrated zkSync Era for ETH and USDC deposits ([Binance Completes Integration of USDC (USDC) on zkSync Era ...](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-completes-integration-of-usdc-usdc-on-zksync-era-network-opens-deposits-and-withdrawals-4d5f23c18eee46c09bfbfdb6f6b67d90#:~:text=,and%20withdrawals%20are%20now%20open))), and Circle launched **native USDC on zkSync** ([Native USDC Now Available on ZKsync - Circle](https://www.circle.com/blog/native-usdc-now-available-on-zksync#:~:text=We%27re%20excited%20to%20announce%20that,users%20%E2%80%93%20no%20bridging%20required)). Many bridging protocols (LayerZero, Orbiter) connect zkSync to other chains. Good liquidity in major tokens (ETH, USDC, etc.) thanks to growing DeFi on Era. |
| **StarkNet**        | ZK Rollup (STARK-based) | Currently sustains ~10–20 TPS in general use, but undergoing rapid upgrades – achieved **127 TPS avg (857 TPS peak)** in a 2024 stress test ([Starknet hits record 857 TPS, averages 127.5 in stress test](https://cointelegraph.com/news/starknet-stress-test-tps-record-scaling-ethereum#:~:text=On%20Oct,in%20a%20controlled%20stress%20test)). Uses validity proofs (STARKs), so no artificial delay on withdrawals. Higher latency than some ZK-rollups due to large proofs (several minutes to prove), but improving. Fees are very low (often a few cents) and expected to drop further as throughput increases. | Launched on Ethereum mainnet in Nov 2021 (alpha). Still **in development** but gained traction: ~$578M TVL ([L2BEAT - The state of the layer two ecosystem](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvs#:~:text=4%20%2085ZKsync%20Era%20,25)). Uses Cairo language (not EVM-compatible by default), which slowed dApp porting initially, but ecosystem is growing with native Cairo devs. StarkNet has its own token (STRK) for decentralization (launched 2023). Many projects building, but user adoption is still smaller than Optimistic rollups. | **MakerDAO** is integrating (e.g. minting DAI on StarkNet) ([Ethereum's MakerDAO to Launch on StarkNet, Promises 10x Lower ...](https://decrypt.co/98252/ethereum-makerdao-launch-starknet-10x-lower-gas-costs#:~:text=Ethereum%27s%20MakerDAO%20to%20Launch%20on,and%20speed%20up%20withdrawal%20times)), and **Chainlink oracles** live. Notable native dApps: **dYdX v3** (perpetuals, on a custom StarkEx instance), **Immutable** is transitioning its games to StarkNet, **Sorare** (fantasy sports) exploring it. Also, native DeFi like **JediSwap** (AMM), **mySwap**, **ZKX** (derivatives) and others in development. The ecosystem is growing, but many apps are awaiting further performance improvements. | Secured by Ethereum (zk-STARK proofs for every state update). Data is on-chain (true rollup). **Operator centralized** – StarkWare currently runs the single sequencer and prover. There is a multi-step roadmap to decentralize: by 2025 the goal is a fully decentralized L2 ([Starknet's road to decentralization in 2025](https://www.starknet.io/blog/decentralized-starknet-2025/#:~:text=Starknet%20is%20on%20the%20road,3%20lanes%E2%80%94read%20about%20them%20here)). Until then, users trust StarkWare for liveness/censorship-resistance (but not for validity, thanks to proofs). The StarkNet token and community council will eventually govern upgrades and sequencer selection. | **Bridge**: Official StarkNet <-> Ethereum bridge (validity-proof based, so fast finality once proofs are posted – usually minutes to an hour). No 7-day wait. Third-party bridges (Orbiter, Multichain) provide additional connectivity to L1 and other L2s. Exchange support is limited but growing (a few exchanges enabled StarkNet withdrawals of STRK or bridged ETH). Liquidity: Several Ethereum-based tokens bridged via StarkGate; Circle’s USDC is not native yet (uses bridged USDC), so stablecoin liquidity depends on bridged assets like USDT/DAI. |
| **Polygon zkEVM**   | ZK Rollup (zkEVM)       | ~10–30 TPS in early stages (expected to scale higher). Uses validity proofs (PlonK-based), achieving full EVM compatibility. Withdrawals finalize in minutes once ZK proof is accepted. Fees are low (on the order of $0.05-$0.10 for token swaps). | Mainnet beta launched Mar 2023. $50M+ TVL ([L2BEAT - The state of the layer two ecosystem](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvs#:~:text=0.10,42)) (smaller so far). Backed by Polygon (who also run Polygon PoS chain). EVM compatibility makes it easy for apps to deploy. Still beta, but actively improving performance. Attracting projects especially those already in Polygon ecosystem. | **Uniswap v3** was deployed after community vote. **Aave** and **Lens Protocol** have plans on Polygon zkEVM. Some Polygon-native DApps (like QuickSwap, a Uniswap fork) launched on zkEVM ([Polygon zkEVM | Explore Dapps & Earn Crypto Rewards - OKX](https://www.okx.com/en-us/web3/cryptopedia/event/polygon-zkevm#:~:text=Polygon%20zkEVM%20,DEX%20and%20AMM%20on)). Overall, notable DeFi protocols are beginning to appear, but ecosystem is in early growth phase compared to Optimism/Arbitrum. | Secured by Ethereum (ZK proofs for each batch). **Sequencer centralized** (run by Polygon Labs). Upgrades/updates are currently controlled by Polygon’s multisig – effectively permissioned in beta. As a ZK-rollup, it benefits from inherent security of proofs, but decentralizing operators and provers is on the roadmap. | **Bridge**: Polygon provides a native zkEVM bridge for ETH and tokens (no withdrawal delay aside from proof time). Some exchanges (e.g. Bitfinex) started supporting direct USDT transfers on zkEVM ([Bitfinex to Support Deposits and Withdrawals on Polygon zkEVM](https://blog.bitfinex.com/media-releases/bitfinex-to-support-deposits-and-withdrawals-on-polygon-zkevm/#:~:text=Bitfinex%20to%20Support%20Deposits%20and,the%20Polygon%20zkEVM%20transport%20layer)). Cross-chain bridges like Orbiter and MultiChain also support it. Liquidity is growing – many users bridge assets from Polygon PoS or Ethereum. Native USDC was not initially on zkEVM, but bridged USDC is available; Circle may add native support as volume grows. |
| **Scroll**          | ZK Rollup (zkEVM)       | Targets full Ethereum equivalence, which initially limits TPS (perhaps a few TPS in early mainnet) but ensures maximum compatibility. Expect to scale to hundreds TPS as proving and data posting optimize. Very low fees (testnets showed <0.05$ fees). | Launched 2024 (after lengthy testnets). Still in **early mainnet** – ~$280M TVL ([L2BEAT - The state of the layer two ecosystem](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvs#:~:text=8%20%2089World%20Chain%20,29)), likely aided by incentive programs. The focus is on accuracy to L1-Ethereum (Type-1 zkEVM), so development was slower. Growing developer community from those who tested it. | Many projects from testnet likely to deploy. **Across Protocol** (bridge) went live on Scroll ([Across is now live on Scroll - Medium](https://medium.com/across-protocol/across-is-now-live-on-scroll-c48977bc73ae#:~:text=Across%20is%20now%20live%20on,Across%27%20presence%20on%20Layer%202)). Expect blue-chips like Uniswap and Aave to consider deployment given ease of porting (type-1 equivalence). The ecosystem is in bootstrapping phase, with infrastructure (oracles, bridges) coming online and DeFi/NFT projects to follow. | Fully inherits Ethereum security (validity proofs). **Sequencer centralized** at launch (Scroll team or foundation operates it). As a zkEVM, it benefits from provable correctness; decentralizing the proving and sequencing is planned once the network stabilizes. Community governance mechanisms are likely to emerge (potential token not yet live publicly). | **Bridge**: Scroll’s official bridge allows quick withdrawals after ZK proof verification. Third-party bridges (LayerZero, etc.) are starting to integrate to link Scroll with other chains. Limited exchange support initially – users mostly bridge from Ethereum or use on-chain DEXs. Liquidity is being incentivized; major assets (ETH, stablecoins) are available via bridges, but deep liquidity will depend on more dApps launching. |
| **Linea** (Consensys zkEVM) | ZK Rollup (zkEVM) | Claims full EVM equivalence with high TPS potential. Removes the 7-day delay of optimistic rollups ([Overview - Linea Docs - Linea.Build](https://docs.linea.build/get-started#:~:text=Overview%20,other%20layer%202%20solutions)) – offers immediate finality after proofs. During testnet, Linea demonstrated fast throughput; expected to handle hundreds of TPS as it matures. Low fees similar to other zkEVMs (few cents). | Launched 2023 by ConsenSys (after a popular testnet). Now on mainnet with ~$433M TVL ([L2BEAT - The state of the layer two ecosystem](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvs#:~:text=5%20%2086Starknet%20%2025%24567,01%20M)). Benefited from MetaMask integration (easy user access). Developer adoption is growing, with many projects from testnet carrying over. Still labeled beta but relatively robust. | **Uniswap, Compound** tested on testnet; various DeFi like **SyncSwap** and **LineaSwap** went live. Given ConsenSys backing, infrastructure projects (Infura, Truffle) support it, making deployment smooth. Expect increasing deployments of mainstream Ethereum dApps (MetaMask’s user base eases onboarding). | Secured by Ethereum (ZK-SNARK proofs). **Sequencer is centralized** (run by ConsenSys). The system is permissioned at launch (for upgrades and operators) but with an intent to decentralize as it stabilizes. No native token (at launch), governance/trust rests with ConsenSys – a reputable entity but not decentralized. | **Bridge**: Native Linea bridge for fast L1 transfers (no long wait). MetaMask and ConsenSys provide easy bridging UI. Some major exchanges and fiat gateways might integrate given ConsenSys relationships (as of 2024, mainly users bridging via MetaMask). Liquidity on Linea is growing – stablecoins and ETH bridged from mainnet. Circle’s USDC support is likely if volume justifies (not confirmed yet). |
| **Taiko**           | ZK Rollup (Type-1 zkEVM) | Aims for Ethereum-equivalent zkEVM, so initial TPS is modest (similar to Scroll). Prioritizes validity and decentralization over raw speed early on. Will improve throughput gradually. Fees are low; proving costs are optimized for efficiency long-term. | Still in testnet/alpha as of early 2025 (no major public TVL yet aside from testing ~\$157M in bridging ([L2BEAT - The state of the layer two ecosystem](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvs#:~:text=13%20%2094Mode%20%2033%2415,36))). Taiko is community-driven (no big corporate backer), focusing on permissionless principles. Developer excitement is high due to its goal of truly decentralized zkEVM. | Not live with dApps on mainnet yet. Several projects have signaled interest once Taiko is ready – likely standard DeFi suite (DEX, lending) and perhaps unique community initiatives. The team ran incentivized testnets to engage future builders. | Will be secured by Ethereum via ZK proofs. **Designed for decentralization**: Taiko plans to allow permissionless provers and sequencers from launch or soon after. Currently, in alpha, the team runs the system, but ethos is to minimize central trust. No official token yet (one expected for incentivizing provers/sequencers). | **Bridge**: Uses a trustless bridge with validity proofs for Ethereum. Since in testing, only testnet bridges operated. On mainnet launch, expect immediate finality bridging like other ZK rollups. Broader ecosystem support (exchanges, etc.) will depend on usage; likely initially reliant on user-driven bridges from Ethereum. |
| **Loopring**        | ZK Rollup (zkSNARK, specialized) | ~2,000 TPS for transfers/trades (Loopring’s zk circuits are optimized for swaps) ([Technology | zkSync Lite Documentation](https://zksync.io/faq/tech.html#:~:text=Technology%20,can%20process%20over%202000%20TPS)). Very low fees (<$0.01 for trades). Fast proof generation (using Groth16 SNARKs) yields quick finality on withdrawals (minutes). | Live since 2020 – one of the earliest L2s. $35M TVL ([L2BEAT - The state of the layer two ecosystem](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvs#:~:text=25%20%20106Loopring%20%2045%2435,46)) (mostly DEX liquidity). Mature in its niche (DEX and payments), but not a general smart contract platform (smart contracts support is limited). Wallet adoption (Loopring smart wallet) has onboarded users to L2 trading. | **Loopring DEX** (order-book style decentralized exchange) and **Loopring Wallet** (with integrated L2). Mostly used for swapping ETH, ERC20s and trading with low slippage. Some NFT functionality added. It’s a *purpose-built* L2, so notable “projects” are essentially Loopring’s own services rather than third-party dApps. | Secured by Ethereum (ZK validity proofs for every batch). Loopring’s operators run the relayer/sequencer; the system is not permissionless (users rely on Loopring, Ltd. to operate the service). However, all funds are non-custodial due to the rollup design. Loopring has a token (LRC) used for staking by relayers and governance, but the network itself is not decentralized in node operation. | **Bridge**: Loopring’s wallet app provides L1<>L2 transfer, with quick finality once SNARK proof is accepted on L1. Users can also withdraw via the Loopring web interface. Some exchanges (e.g. GameStop’s wallet, as Loopring partnered with GameStop NFT) support direct Layer-2 interactions. Liquidity within Loopring is sufficient for its DEX, and users typically deposit/withdraw through Ethereum mainnet. |
| **StarkEx-based Validiums** (Immutable X, dydX v3, Sorare, etc.) | ZK **Validium** (ZK proofs, data off-chain) | Very high throughput (Immutable X does ~9,000 TPS for trades, dYdX handled 10+ trades per second easily). Practically zero fees for end-users (Immutable X mints/trades NFTs with no gas). Low latency (transactions confirmed off-chain instantly, validity proof periodically submitted on L1). | These are **application-specific L2s** using StarkWare’s StarkEx tech (live since ~2020). Not general networks – each is tailored to an app. **Immutable X** (NFT trading/gaming platform) has significant adoption (popular games, millions of NFT trades). **dYdX v3** (perpetuals DEX) was successful on StarkEx but is migrating to its own chain. **Sorare** (fantasy sports NFTs) runs on StarkEx with a sizable user base. | **Immutable X:** marketplaces for games like Gods Unchained, Illuvium; **Sorare:** sports NFT market; **RhinoFi (DeversiFi):** DeFi trading; **dYdX:** perpetual futures trading (though moving off L2 soon). Each of these “projects” is both the platform and the L2 itself. They demonstrate L2 scalability for specific verticals. | Security: They use validity proofs (so transactions are correct), but **data availability is off-chain** (Validium mode). This means users trust a data committee or the operator to not withhold data. If the operator becomes malicious or goes down, users might not be able to exit (unlike a rollup). For example, Immutable X uses a data committee (including StarkWare) to guard data. Decentralization: Sequencers are centralized (the company runs it), and these systems often have admin keys. They are not permissionless, but offer high performance for their use-case. | **Bridging:** Typically, these have custom bridges. Users deposit assets via a smart contract to the L2 operator’s control and withdraw through the project’s interface. Because of off-chain data, trust in the operator is required for bridging. Some projects have begun adding escape hatches or moving toward rollup (Immutable is planning a zkEVM rollup with Polygon). Liquidity: These platforms usually isolate liquidity to their application (e.g. IMX token and game assets on Immutable, trading liquidity on dYdX). Integration with external exchanges is case-by-case (e.g. Coinbase supported direct withdrawal of NFTs from Immutable X via their wallet). |
| **Aztec (Aztec Connect)** | ZK Rollup (privacy-focused) | ~100 TPS for private transfers at its peak. Used zkSNARKs to enable shielded Ethereum transactions with ~15–30 min batching intervals. Higher fees than other L2s (due to heavy crypto computations) – a few dollars per tx, but enabled batching multiple transfers. | Aztec Connect (version 1) launched 2021 providing private payment channels on Ethereum DeFi (now **deprecated** as of 2023). It had moderate use for private transactions (around $20M TVL before shutdown). The team is now working on a next-gen encrypted L2 (Noir programming language) to launch in 2024–25. | Previously integrated with DeFi like **MakerDAO, Aave, Element** to allow users to interact privately (via Aztec’s zkDAO). The new Aztec is expected to support fully programmable private smart contracts, so future projects might include private DEXs, gaming, etc. Currently, no active user-facing L2 (until the new version). | Security: Aztec v1 was a ZK-rollup on Ethereum (secure and data on-chain). It leveraged PLONK proofs for privacy. Decentralization: The v1 had a centralized sequencer (Aztec company) and a fixed set of relayers. The upcoming Aztec aims for a **fully decentralized, encrypted** L2, but details pending. | **Bridge:** Aztec v1 users deposited ETH to a contract and received zETH on L2. Withdrawals took one Ethereum block (proof verified). The system required users to be online to generate spend proofs. Aztec Connect’s lifecycle ended in 2023 (users had a grace period to withdraw). The future Aztec version will have its own bridging for private transfers. Liquidity: was limited (mostly used for private DAI and ETH transfers). The new Aztec is expected to partner with liquidity providers for bridging in/out privately. |
| **Polygon PoS (Sidechain)** | Plasma/PoS Sidechain (Ethereum commit-chain) | ~7,000+ TPS theoretical, typically a few hundred TPS in practice. ~2 second block time. Very low fees (<$0.01). Uses a hybrid of Plasma (for security of exits) and Proof-of-Stake checkpoints to Ethereum (every ~30 min). | Launched in 2019 (formerly Matic). **Highly adopted**: ~$1B+ TVL, thousands of dApps. Often counted among “L2 solutions,” though it’s technically a sidechain with its own validators. Wide usage in DeFi, gaming (e.g. Reddit NFTs, etc.) and NFTs due to early mover advantage. MATIC token secures network. | Virtually every major dApp: **Aave, Uniswap, Curve, Sushi, QuickSwap**, NFT platforms (OpenSea supports Polygon), gaming (Sandbox, Decentraland use Polygon for transactions), and many others. It’s one of the most expansive ecosystems outside Ethereum L1. | Security: **Not a true L2**, but rather a separate PoS network that relies on its own validator set (100+ validators staking MATIC). It commits checkpoints to Ethereum for finality and uses Plasma fraud proofs for extra security of certain asset exits ([How to Deposit and Withdraw on Polygon PoS Commit-chain on ...](https://polygon.technology/blog/how-to-deposit-and-withdraw-on-polygon-pos-commit-chain-on-binance#:~:text=,walk%20you%20through%20a)). However, if >2/3 of its validators collude, they could attack the chain (thus less secure than rollups). Decentralization: More decentralized than single-sequencer rollups (many validators run the chain), but still a limited set and historically a multi-sig controlled upgrades. | **Bridge:** Polygon PoS has a popular bridge to Ethereum. Withdrawals of some assets use Plasma (7-day wait) or a faster PoS exit (for certain tokens). Most major exchanges support direct deposits/withdrawals on Polygon (e.g. Binance, Coinbase). **Fiat onramps** (MoonPay, Transak) support it. Native USDC is issued on Polygon PoS (Circle support since 2022), giving ample stablecoin liquidity. |
| **State Channels (Raiden, Connext)** | State Channels          | **Instant throughput** (limited only by peer connection speed; effectively thousands TPS between channel participants). Negligible fees once channel is open. However, opening/closing a channel requires on-chain tx. Best for repetitive payments. | **Raiden Network:** live on Ethereum mainnet (focus on ERC-20 payments, launched 2018). Limited adoption (never reached mass usage, a few dApps experimented). **Connext:** evolved state-channels into a cross-chain payment network (now mostly used for bridging liquidity across L2s). State channels overall have seen low ecosystem growth compared to rollups. | **Raiden** was used by some early token transfer demos; not widely integrated into apps (as liquidity shifting to rollups). **Connext** pivoted to a bridge/router for users moving funds across chains (using a variant of channels under the hood). Some games and casinos have used state channels for instant microtransactions (e.g. serial betting games) in the past. | Security: In state channels, users rely on multi-party signatures. Funds are secured by on-chain smart contracts that can settle disputes. **Fully decentralized** between channel members (no global operator). However, if a user goes offline and another tries to cheat, the offline user must respond on-chain within a timeout or risk fund loss. Hence, requires monitoring or use of third-party watchtowers. | **Bridging:** State channels themselves don’t require “bridging” – they are opened with an on-chain deposit and closed to settle. Connext’s network acts as a bridge among chains by having nodes with channels on multiple networks. Liquidity: In Raiden, liquidity had to be locked in channels (some hubs provided larger liquidity for routing). In Connext, liquidity providers stake funds on each chain to facilitate transfers. No direct fiat onramps – users enter channels via on-chain deposits. |
| **Plasma Chains (historical)** | Plasma (UTXO-based sidechains) | High TPS (Plasma chains could aggregate many txs off-chain). However, Plasma only batches state changes and requires challenging exits which can be slow. Fees were lower than mainnet, but Plasma design was complex for general smart contracts. | Developed 2017–2019, but **largely phased out** in favor of rollups. **OMG Network** was a notable Plasma implementation (launched as OmiseGO). It achieved some usage for payments but ultimately struggled with UX (exit games) and was supplanted by newer tech. OMG’s successor is now Boba (an optimistic rollup). | OMG Network had a few payment applications and exchange integrations (it aimed to scale Tether transfers originally). No major DeFi or NFT projects used Plasma due to its limitations (no composability). Plasma is now mostly of academic/historic interest, superseded by rollups. | Security: Plasma relies on Ethereum for finality and uses fraud proofs for exits. Users must monitor and submit challenge proofs if needed within exit periods. If the operator withholds data, users can exit with last valid state (but this requires everyone to keep proofs of funds). Decentralization: Plasma chains typically had a centralized operator or a fixed small set. They were not centralized in custody (users could exit funds) but not truly decentralized in block production either. | **Bridging:** Plasma uses an exit protocol: users deposit into a contract, transact off-chain, and then withdraw by submitting proofs. Withdrawals had long waits (1-2 weeks or more) to allow challenges. Liquidity moving out was slow; moving in was easier (regular deposit). Few fiat onramps (OMG had some integrations in Southeast Asia for payments). With rollups now offering better UX, Plasma networks like OMG have been deprecated. | 

**Notes:** “TVL” = total value locked. **Optimistic Rollups** have a ~7-day withdrawal period due to fraud-proof challenge windows ([Arbitrum FAQ | Arbitrum Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/learn-more/faq#:~:text=Why%20was%20,for%20Arbitrum%20One%27s%20dispute%20window)) (though this can be accelerated via liquidity providers). **ZK-Rollups** use validity proofs, so withdrawals are fast once a proof is verified. Most L2s currently have **centralized sequencers** (transaction ordering nodes) operated by the project team, but inherit security from Ethereum L1. Efforts to decentralize sequencers and validate proofs (where applicable) are ongoing across networks. Each L2 typically has a **canonical bridge** to Ethereum for moving assets, and many are supported by cross-chain bridges and exchange integrations for convenience. The ecosystem is evolving rapidly, with new L2s (and even L3s) launching and improving over time, all aimed at scaling Ethereum while maintaining security and decentralization trade-offs.
